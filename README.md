# Curt
### What is it
Free and open-source self-hosted url shortener service written in Go.
### How to run
Pull and run the [docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/salvatoreemilio/curt) image or build it from source.
### Caveats
To date, as Curt does not support any form of authentication is supposed to run behind a middleware API that can manage that for it and in the same time provide an HTTPS connection.
